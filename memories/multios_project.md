# MultiOS Website Design Project

## Project Status
- **Phase**: Material Discovery Complete → Moving to Style Options
- **Task**: Create UI design specification (NOT building website)
- **Date**: 2025-11-03

## Key Project Insights

### 1. Industry & Position
- **Industry**: Educational Operating System (OS education, systems programming)
- **Position**: Revolutionary educational OS written in Rust
- **Competitors**: Traditional OS textbooks, legacy educational OSs
- **Direction**: Modern, production-ready, cross-platform (x86_64, ARM64, RISC-V)

### 2. Target Users
- **Primary**: Educators (university professors, instructors), Students (CS majors, learners)
- **Secondary**: Researchers (academic research), Developers (OS developers, contributors)
- **Tertiary**: Institutions (universities, schools, research labs)
- **Age**: 18-35 (students/young professionals) + 30-65 (educators/researchers)
- **Technical Literacy**: High - computer science professionals

### 3. Core Goal
- **Primary**: Drive adoption in educational institutions
- **Secondary**: Build developer community, showcase technical capabilities
- **Success Metrics**: Educational adoption, downloads, contributions

### 4. Brand Personality
- **Position**: Professional Academic / Technical Excellence
- **Tone**: Authoritative yet approachable, innovative, trustworthy
- **Style**: Modern professional, clean, technical but accessible
- **Values**: Education-first, open source, quality, innovation

### 5. Content Overview
- **Volume**: 85,000+ words of documentation
- **Type**: Mixed (technical docs, educational resources, system specs, community materials)
- **Structure**: 10 major sections (Homepage, Demos, Features, Download, Educators, Developers, Community, Research, Blog, About)
- **Density**: High - comprehensive technical and educational content

## Material Inventory
- `/workspace/FINAL_PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Project overview, achievements, architecture
- `/workspace/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` - 3-year development plan, future features
- `/workspace/education/` - Educational resources, tutorials, workshops
- `/workspace/community/` - Developer portal, contribution guidelines
- `/workspace/academic/` - Academic platform, research API, curriculum
- `/workspace/docs/` - Technical documentation, guides, examples
- Multiple implementation reports and technical specs

## Website Structure Decision
- **Type**: MPA (Multi-Page Application)
- **Reasoning**: 
  - 10 major sections with distinct purposes
  - 85,000+ words of content
  - Multiple user personas with different needs
  - Complex navigation requirements
  - Educational institution audience expects traditional multi-page structure

## Next Steps
1. Generate 3 style options for client review
2. Wait for client style selection
3. Retrieve style guide
4. Create content structure plan
5. Generate design specification
6. Generate design tokens JSON
