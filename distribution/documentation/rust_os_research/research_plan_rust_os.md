# Rust-Based Operating Systems Research Plan

## Research Objective
Analyze existing Rust-based operating systems and kernels (Redox OS, Theseus, Tock OS) focusing on memory safety, kernel design, architecture support, code organization, development patterns, and practical implementation strategies.

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Information Gathering
- [x] 1.1 Search for Redox OS official documentation and technical papers
- [x] 1.2 Search for Theseus OS documentation and technical resources  
- [x] 1.3 Search for Tock OS documentation and technical materials
- [x] 1.4 Locate and analyze code repositories for all three systems
- [x] 1.5 Find academic papers and technical presentations about these systems

### Phase 2: Deep Analysis
#### Redox OS Analysis
- [x] 2.1 Extract and analyze Redox OS documentation
- [x] 2.2 Study Redox OS memory safety mechanisms
- [x] 2.3 Analyze Redox OS kernel architecture and design patterns
- [x] 2.4 Examine Redox OS code organization and development practices

#### Theseus OS Analysis  
- [x] 2.5 Extract and analyze Theseus OS documentation
- [x] 2.6 Study Theseus OS memory safety approaches
- [x] 2.7 Analyze Theseus OS kernel design and architecture
- [x] 2.8 Examine Theseus OS development patterns and code structure

#### Tock OS Analysis
- [x] 2.9 Extract and analyze Tock OS documentation
- [x] 2.10 Study Tock OS memory safety implementations
- [x] 2.11 Analyze Tock OS kernel architecture and design
- [x] 2.12 Examine Tock OS code organization and development practices

### Phase 3: Cross-System Analysis
- [x] 3.1 Compare memory safety approaches across all three systems
- [x] 3.2 Analyze architectural differences and trade-offs
- [x] 3.3 Identify common patterns and unique innovations
- [x] 3.4 Extract practical implementation strategies and lessons learned

### Phase 4: Report Generation
- [x] 4.1 Compile comprehensive analysis report
- [x] 4.2 Include practical implementation guidance
- [x] 4.3 Document source materials and citations
- [x] 4.4 Final review and validation

## Success Criteria
- Complete analysis of all three Rust-based operating systems
- Deep technical understanding of each system's approach
- Practical implementation strategies and lessons learned
- Comprehensive documentation with proper citations
