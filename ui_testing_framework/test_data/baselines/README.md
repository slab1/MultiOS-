# Placeholder baseline screenshot files
# In a real implementation, these would be actual PNG/JPEG image files

# This directory should contain baseline screenshots for visual regression testing
# Each file represents a known-good state of a UI component

# Recommended naming convention:
# - login_page.png
# - dashboard_main.png
# - settings_dialog.png
# - navigation_menu.png
# - main_toolbar.png
# - status_bar.png

# Each baseline should be:
# - High resolution (at least 1920x1080)
# - Clear of dynamic content (no timestamps, animations)
# - Representative of the expected UI state
# - Captured under consistent conditions

# For accessibility testing, consider creating multiple baselines for:
# - Different themes (light, dark, high contrast)
# - Different zoom levels (100%, 125%, 150%, 200%)
# - Different accessibility configurations
