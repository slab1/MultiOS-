## 🎯 Overview

MultiOS is a community-driven operating system project that aims to provide a unified, efficient, and secure operating system platform across multiple architectures including x86_64, ARM64, and RISC-V. Our community welcomes developers of all skill levels to contribute to this ambitious project.

### Project Vision
- **Multi-Architecture Support**: Seamless operation across different CPU architectures
- **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Support for desktop, mobile, IoT, and embedded devices
- **Performance Optimization**: Maximum performance with minimal resource usage
- **Security First**: Built with security and safety as core principles
- **Community-Driven**: Open development with transparent decision-making

## 🚀 Getting Started
